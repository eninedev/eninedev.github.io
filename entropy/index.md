## Honor Code

> [!important]
> I will not lie, cheat, or steal. I will not tolerate those who violate the Honor Code.

The Trainee commits to neither give nor receive assistance while completing assignments and that their work is their own in its entirety. 

Trainees are expected to commit to the Honor Code as admission into the Training Program.

A Trainee who is found to have violated the Honor Code will be terminated with cause immediately.

### Three rules of thumb
