# [Entropy](index.md) - Handbook

[Entropy](index.md) is a rigorous and exclusive training program from [1E9 Advisors](https://enine.dev/) for Software Engineers who write code in Python and Django.

Entropy is an invitation-only program and ongoing participation is at the discretion of 1E9 Advisors.
